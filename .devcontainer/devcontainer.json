<p>What I want to ask is:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Do you feel disadvantaged by the incorrect method of typing Control+Shift+M?</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>Suppose the typing is intended to create an email? Ctrl+Shift+M removes a paragraph indent. In Outlook, it creates a new email, even from different views. In other applications, it may have different functions, such as removing a paragraph indent or creating a new document. Ctrl+N may be the method I wrote incorrectly for such objects, but Ctrl+Shift+M is only a method for removing Outlook. Coincidentally, my account is currently blocked by Outlook. If you don't believe my assumption, please check my Gmail status at acidabdulrazied@gmail.com and aaci23030.com, maybe two months ago.</li>

<p>What I want to ask you is about my writing method in my personal storage: Ctrl + Shift + dev2352.<br>dev2352 is my mobile device. Suppose I type Ctrl + Shift + V.<br>Ctrl + Shift + V is a keyboard shortcut commonly used to paste text as plain text (without formatting) in various applications and browsers. This might be completely wrong. This might not affect you, but for me, the red color in my browser indicates that the signal traffic flow has been compromised by something.</p>

>> nodejs+docs+sample/container

This file contains instructions for building a Docker image,
including specifying the base Node.js image, copying the application files, 
installing dependencies, and defining commands to run the application.
Why should the method be nodejs+docs+sample/container? Why not nodejs+docs+sample/mobile or nodejs+docs+sample/airplane? 
Because these methods have no personal or organizational function, while nodejs+docs+sample/container's main function is to define commands for 
each application connected in a program or installation. Discussion of this algorithm when faced with a judge and each person asks who is wrong. Thank you.
